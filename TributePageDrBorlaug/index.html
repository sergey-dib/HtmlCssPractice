                        Initially, Borlaug's work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of
                        Chapingo near Texcoco, where the problems with rust and poor soil were most prevalent. The
                        village never met their aims. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of
                        the country's two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands
                        as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the Yaqui Valley research station near Ciudad
                        Obreg√≥n, Sonora. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown
                        each year.

                        Borlaug's boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling
                        the work, Borlaug's plan went against a then-held principle of agronomy that has since been
                        disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds
                        needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin
                        Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing
                        his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then
                        be bred at locations 700 miles (1000 km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500 feet
                        (2600 m) apart in altitude. This was called "shuttle breeding".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with
                        photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing
                        periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, "As it worked out, in the north, we were planting
                        when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the
                        seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer
                        and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That
                        wasn't supposed to happen by the books".[23] This meant that the project would not need to start
                        separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.

                    <h3>Increasing disease resistance through linear varieties of wheat</h3>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Because pure line (genotypically identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major genes for disease resistance, and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiple linear lines varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent.[25] Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the pathogen. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.
